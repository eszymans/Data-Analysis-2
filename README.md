# K-Means Clustering Analysis

## Overview

This project is a group assignment for university studies. It focuses on implementing and analyzing the k-means clustering algorithm, a classic method for data grouping.

## Features

- **K-Means Algorithm Implementation**
  - Implements the k-means clustering algorithm
  - Demonstrates the algorithm’s functionality using a modified Iris dataset (without species labels).
- **Data Clustering and Visualization**
  - Performs clustering in a four-dimensional space using all four features.
  - Visualizes clustering results using scatter plots for six possible feature pairs.
- **WCSS and Iteration Analysis**
  - Runs k-means clustering for values of k ranging from 2 to 10.
  - Records the number of iterations required for convergence.
  - Calculates and plots the WCSS (Within-Cluster Sum of Squares) values for k = 2 to 10.

## Output

The program generates:

- Clustered scatter plots for all six feature pairs.
- A plot of WCSS values for k = 2 to 10.
- The number of iterations required for convergence at each k.

## Dataset

The dataset is a modified version of the Iris dataset, containing 150 samples with four numerical features:

1. Sepal length (cm)
2. Sepal width (cm)
3. Petal length (cm)
4. Petal width (cm)

Species labels are ignored for clustering purposes.
